[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/Chiheb-Nexus/ShapeShift-cmd/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/Chiheb-Nexus/ShapeShift-cmd/latest)

Exchange cyrptocurrencies using command line with ShapeShift.io

#Dependencies:
	. Python3

#Disclamer:
This script was tested with BTC/LTC, LTC/BTC, BTC/DOGE, DOGE/BTC, BTC/DASH and DAHS/BTC.
Don't use it if you want to exchange Coin/NXT or NXT/Coin. This script doen't support NXT yet.
I'll fix this issue in the next version.
